# ubx-v2x
## V2X baseband simulation model

ubx-v2x is a simulation model of a baseband 802.11p/bd transceiver which can be used for research on V2X communications. It provides a reference implementation of all the mandatory transmitter and receiver processing blocks. It also includes implementations of the V2V channel models summarized in [1], originating from test trials described in [2-4].

## Introduction

The goal of ubx-v2x is to stimulate research on algorithms for current and next-generation V2X communications systems. The main advantage of this model compared to existing 802.11 implementations is the provision of a channel tracking mechanism which is crucial in investigating high-mobility scenarios.

## MEX Acceleration (optional)

Simulation performance can be significantly improved by using (compiled) MEX files for the high-level transmitter `sim_tx` and receiver `sim_rx` functions. These functions and the ones below them have been written in a way which enables code generation as described [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/code-generation-from-matlab.html).

Compilation of the MEX files for your platform can be performed by executing `codegen_script` from the top-level directory. Once the MEX files are created inside the `mex` folder, MEX-acceleration can be enabled by setting `SIM.use_mex = true;` at the top of `batch_sim`.

## Requirements

ubx-v2x requires the following software from The MathWorks, Inc.

- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Communications System Toolbox
- MATLAB Coder (optional, for MEX generation only)

A supported compiler is also needed for MEX acceleration, as specified [here](https://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers.html).
